# LW3Punks NFT Dapp

Welcome to the LW3Punks NFT Dapp! This dapp allows you to mint unique LW3Punks NFTs on the Polygon Mumbai testnet. Here's how you can get started:

## Upload Images and Metadata to IPFS

1. Sign up for [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) to upload and pin your NFT images and metadata on IPFS.

2. Download the LW3Punks folder to your computer and upload it to Pinata, naming the folder "LW3Punks".

3. Note the CID (Content Identifier) generated for your folder.

4. To check if your folder is on IPFS, use this URL: [https://ipfs.io/ipfs/your-nft-folder-cid](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/your-nft-folder-cid), replacing "your-nft-folder-cid" with the CID you received from Pinata.

5. Upload metadata files for each NFT as JSON files. Example metadata structure is provided in the project.

6. Name the folder containing metadata files "metadata" and upload it to Pinata.

7. Note the CID generated for your metadata folder.

8. To check if your metadata folder is on IPFS, use this URL: [https://ipfs.io/ipfs/your-metadata-folder-cid](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/your-metadata-folder-cid), replacing "your-metadata-folder-cid" with the CID you received from Pinata.

## Deploy the Smart Contract

2. Create a new file named "LW3Punks.sol" in the `NFT-IPFS/backend/contracts` directory and paste the provided smart contract code.

4. Compile the contract using `npx hardhat compile`.

5. Deploy the contract to the Mumbai network using `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai`.
